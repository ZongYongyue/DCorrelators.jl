# DCorrelators.jl

*A convenient frontend for calculating dynamical correlation functions and related observables based on matrix-product states time evolution methods.*

## Introduction

- The symbolic operator representation of a quantum lattice system in condensed matter physics the package [`QuantumLattices`](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl.git)

- The matrix-product states time evolution methods such as TEBD, MPO $W^{II}$ and TDVP are based on packages   [`ITensors`](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl.git) and [`MPSKit`](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MPSKit.jl.git)

- The bechmark of dynamical correlation functions and related observables is the result from exact diagonalization method based on the packages [`ExactDiagonalization`](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/ExactDiagonalization.jl.git)
